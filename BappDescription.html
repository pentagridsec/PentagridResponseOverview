<p>
	Response Overview groups HTTP response bodies by similarity and presents one request/response per group. This
	provides security testers with an efficient method to identify anomalies, exotic error messages, and overlooked
	functionality across all responses captured from any Burp tool.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

		responses</li>

	<li>Processes responses from all Burp tools in real-time with configurable filtering by scope, file extension, and
